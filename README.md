I forked this from https://github.com/juliemr/ng2-test-seed mostly for personal use. You probably want the original.

But FYI, here's what's different:

1. Upgraded to Angular 2.0 beta 0. (I'm sure that's coming soon anyway!)
2. Cleaned up what I subjectively consider clutter: extraneous code, comments, code with readability issues.
